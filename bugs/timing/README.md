# Timing / Oracle Manipulation

## Major Real-World Incidents Involving Similar Vulnerabilities

### **bZx Protocol (February 2020)**

- **First Attack**: $350,000 stolen through oracle manipulation
- **Second Attack**: $630,000 stolen just 4 days later [[1]](https://cryptobriefing.com/2388-eth-estimated-lost-bzxs-second-exploit/)
- **Method**: Attackers used flash loans to manipulate sUSD prices via Kyber Network oracle, causing bZx to accept inflated collateral values [[2]](https://www.aon.com/en/insights/cyber-labs/flash-loan-attacks-a-case-study) [[3]](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.01230v1)
- **Impact**: Demonstrated how timing assumptions in oracle feeds can be exploited repeatedly

### **Mango Markets (October 2022)**

- **Loss**: Over $100 million stolen [[4]](https://www.theblock.co/post/176445/hacker-steals-over-100-million-from-mango-markets)
- **Method**: Avraham Eisenberg manipulated MNGO token price across multiple exchanges to inflate collateral value [[5]](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-analyze-an-attack-a-case-on-the-mango-markets-hack-f1d4389c009f)
- **Legal outcome**: Eisenberg was prosecuted by DOJ, SEC, and CFTC for market manipulation [[6]](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8647-23)
- **Connection**: Shows real-world consequences of oracle timing assumptions

### **PancakeBunny (May 2021)**

- **Loss**: $45 million stolen [[7]](https://www.theblock.co/post/105473/bsc-pancakebunny-defi-protocol-exploited-lost-45-million-bunny)
- **Token impact**: BUNNY crashed from $146 to $6 (95% loss)
- **Method**: Flash loan attack exploiting oracle manipulation to mint 7 million BUNNY tokens [[8]](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/the-tragicomedy-of-pancakebunny) [[9]](https://www.merklescience.com/blog/hack-track-pancake-bunny-hack)
- **Recovery**: Partial compensation plan implemented [[10]](https://pancakebunny.medium.com/polybunny-post-mortem-compensation-42b5c35ce957)

### **Warp Finance (December 2020)**

- **Loss**: $7.7 million stolen [[11]](https://cointelegraph.com/news/after-exploit-warp-finance-compensation-plan-takes-promising-strides)
- **Recovery**: 75% of funds recovered ($5.85 million) [[12]](https://www.theblock.co/post/88645/defi-protocol-warp-finance-recovered-funds-flash-loan-attack)
- **Method**: Flash loan attack manipulating Warp's price oracle system [[13]](https://slowmist.medium.com/analysis-of-warp-finance-hacked-incident-cb12a1af74cc)
- **Impact**: Led to increased focus on robust price oracles in DeFi

### Why These Matter

These incidents demonstrate that blockchain parameter assumptions (like block times) and oracle timing vulnerabilities aren't theoreticalâ€”they've caused hundreds of millions in losses. The Basin MultiFlowPump vulnerability follows the same pattern: hardcoded timing assumptions that attackers can exploit when network conditions change.
