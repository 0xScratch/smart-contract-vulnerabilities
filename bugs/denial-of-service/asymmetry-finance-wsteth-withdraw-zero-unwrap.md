## Summary

A rounding-to-zero edge case in Lido's wstETH conversion logic can cause `WstEth.withdraw(_amount)` to revert when `_amount` is as low as 1 wei and the global Lido pooled ETH is less than total wstETH shares. Because `safETH.unstake()` batches proportional withdrawals across all derivatives, a failure in this single derivative blocks the entire unstaking operation for all users.

## A Better Explanation (With Simplified Example)

To understand this bug, let's break it down in simple steps ‚Äî starting from what the protocol is doing, how wstETH math works under the hood, and when things can go wrong.

### üß† What's Happening Under the Hood

`safETH` is a protocol that diversifies your ETH among several **liquid staking tokens** (also called *derivatives*), such as:

- Lido's **wstETH**
- Rocket Pool's **rETH**
- Frax's **sfrxETH**

This means:

- When you stake ETH into `safETH`, the protocol **splits** your ETH into different pools.
- When you **unstake**, it needs to **pull back** ETH from each derivative according to its remaining balance.

So if a user is withdrawing 50% of safETH supply, the protocol will try to withdraw 50% of whatever's in each derivative.

Now: suppose wstETH has only **2 wei** left ‚Äî the unstake function will attempt to withdraw **1 wei** from it.

That's where things go wrong.

### üßÆ What Does `WstEth.withdraw()` Actually Do?

Inside the wstETH wrapper, the `withdraw(_amount)` function tries to **unwrap** `wstETH` into `stETH` ‚Äî Lido's main staking token.

The line that begins unwrapping:

```solidity
uint256 stEthAmount = IWStETH(WST_ETH).unwrap(_amount);
require(stEthAmount > 0, "No stETH to unwrap");
```

Let's unpack what's behind `unwrap()`.

### üß™ How wstETH Unwrap Works (Zooming In)

When you call `unwrap(1)`, the unwrap function internally converts shares using this formula:

```solidity
amount = shares √ó (totalPooledEther / totalShares)
```

- `shares` = amount of wstETH (in this case, just **1 wei**)
- `totalPooledEther` = the total ETH sitting in the Lido staking validators
- `totalShares` = all shares issued so far for people staking in Lido

So you get back:

```solidity
1 √ó (totalPooledEther / totalShares)
```

### üî• When Can This Be a Problem?

Here's the key:

**If `totalPooledEther < totalShares`, then the ratio becomes less than 1.**

And since Solidity operates using **integer division without decimals**, the calculation will round **down to 0**.

This makes `unwrap(1) = 0`, and that triggers the `require(...)` check:

```solidity
require(stEthAmount > 0, "No stETH to unwrap"); // ‚ùå Reverts
```

Once any one `withdraw()` fails, the `safETH.unstake()` call **aborts for everyone** ‚Äî nobody can withdraw even if they never staked in wstETH.

### üîç Why Could `totalPooledEther < totalShares`?

Some misunderstandings claim this can "never happen." That's not true.

Here are a few *real conditions* where this can happen:

| Case | Why It Happens |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Slashing** | If Lido validators get punished (slashed), total ETH backing stETH (i.e. totalPooledEther) shrinks, but shares stay the same. |
| **Rounding during minting** | Someone deposits ETH and gets more shares than ETH (due to rounding/truncation). |
| **Reward delay** | Lido may delay updating totalPooledEther until validators report. So shares may pre-exist ETH. |
| **Operational bug in Lido or ETH withdrawal logic** | ETH burned, not yet accounted ‚Äî imbalance is created indirectly. |

So yes ‚Äî even if rare, this is **absolutely possible** in real-world DeFi.

### üß© How `_amount == 1` Happens in the First Place?

This part is also easily misunderstood. You might ask:
> "Why would anyone try to unwrap just 1 wei?"

Here's why:

`safETH.unstake()` calls `withdraw()` for *every* derivative ‚Äî regardless of how much is left in that derivative.

Let's say:

- safETH has 1,000 ETH staked
- 1 ETH is remaining in the wstETH derivative (maybe its weight was set to 0 before)
- A user tries to unstake **half** the total safETH supply

Then:

```solidity
‚Üí 0.5 √ó 1 ETH from wstETH = 0.5 ETH ‚Üí call withdraw(0.5 ETH)
```

This results in the protocol calling:

```solidity
unwrap(1) // or whatever amount equals the 0.5 derivative balance
```

And **if** wstETH's underlying exchange rate makes that unwrap equal to **0 stETH**, then the call fails.

Boom, there goes everyone's withdrawal üò¨

‚úì Even better? You didn't even stake in wstETH!
But `safETH` **still calls** wstETH.withdraw() for you, and it fails on a dust-value.

### üçï Real Life Analogy: The Shared Pizza Problem

Imagine this:

- You and 10 friends put money into a shared pizza fund.
- The fund buys pizza from 3 restaurants.
- Months later, you're hungry ‚Äî you want to eat **half** your share.

But the system is set up so that **you must take half of what remains from every restaurant**...

One restaurant only has **1 pepperoni crumb** left.

Now the pizza cutter (smart contract math) tries to give you **half** of that crumb ‚Äî but it's so tiny, the knife can't slice it.

Instead of skipping the crumb, the whole order fails and nobody gets any pizza.

### ‚úÖ Final Summary

| Step | What Happens |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | User calls `safETH.unstake()` |
| 2 | Protocol calculates a proportional withdrawal from **all derivatives**, including wstETH |
| 3 | wstETH receives a withdrawal request with a very small `_amount` (like `1 wei`) |
| 4 | `unwrap(1)` ‚âà 1 √ó (`totalPooledEther` / `totalShares`) = **0** due to rounding |
| 5 | `require(stEthAmount > 0)` fails, causing **revert** |
| 6 | Whole unstake fails ‚Äî users are locked out, even if they never interacted with wstETH |

## Vulnerable Code Reference

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    underlyingBalance = underlyingBalance - _amount;
    uint256 stEthAmount = IWStETH(WST_ETH).unwrap(_amount);
    require(stEthAmount > 0, "No stETH to unwrap");
    IERC20(STETH_TOKEN).approve(LIDO_CRV_POOL, stEthAmount);
    ...
}
```

## Impact

- **DoS**: Users cannot unstake any ETH because a single wei in one derivative can block the entire batch operation.
- **Protocol-Wide Liveness Risk**: Even users without wstETH exposure are affected.
- **Reputation Damage**: A live "can't withdraw" event undermines trust and may force emergency admin interventions.

## Mitigation

Replace the fatal `require` with a soft-fail guard:

```diff
- require(stEthAmount > 0, "No stETH to unwrap");
+ if (stEthAmount == 0) {
+     return; // Skip zero-value unwrap without reverting
+ }
```

This early return allows other derivatives to complete withdrawals while leaving negligible dust untouched.

## Pattern Recognition Notes

- **Denial of Service via Batch Reverts**: Iterating through multiple adapters where a single revert halts the entire process.
- **Edge-Case Precision Errors**: Integer division rounding down when assets < shares.
- **Dust Management**: Always anticipate "1 wei" scenarios; skip or burn dust rather than revert.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Favor `if (x == 0) return;` over `require(x > 0)` in multi-step, multi-adapter functions.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Provide means to disable or skip failing adapters without halting core user flows.
