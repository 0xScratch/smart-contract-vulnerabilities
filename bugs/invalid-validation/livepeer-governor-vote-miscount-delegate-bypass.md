>A delegate can subtract their own voting weight from the voting choice of another delegate, even if that user isn't a transcoder.

## Summary

The Livepeer governance system allows users to delegate their voting power to transcoders. However, when a user (delegator) overrides a vote that was previously delegated, the system blindly deducts vote weight from the delegate ‚Äî even if that delegate is no longer an active transcoder or has never voted. This results in incorrect tallies and potential vote misaccounting, undermining the accuracy of governance outcomes.

## A Better Explanation (With Simplified Example)

To understand this bug in Livepeer, let's walk through it like a story ‚Äî starting with how **delegation and voting** work in the protocol, and where things go wrong.

### üß† What's the Voting Model in Livepeer?

In Livepeer governance:

* Users can either **vote directly** on proposals, or
* **Delegate their voting power** to a **transcoder**, who votes on their behalf.

Each user has an associated `bond` which tracks:

* How much stake they've delegated
* To which address (a transcoder)

If the user **doesn't vote manually**, their vote is counted via the **transcoder's vote**, weighted by their delegated amount.

If the user **does vote manually**, the protocol:

1. **Overrides** the delegator's vote over their transcoder.
2. **Deducts** their weight from the transcoder's total (to prevent double-counting).
3. **Adds** their vote individually.

### üì¶ So What's the Problem?

This all works great ‚Äî *if the delegate is a transcoder*.

But there's a catch: **anyone** can receive delegation (not just transcoders). And if that "delegate" isn't a transcoder, they **don't gain any vote weight from those delegations**.

So what happens when a delegator **overrides** such a vote?

> üí• The protocol still tries to *deduct* the delegator's weight from the **non-transcoder delegate** ‚Äî even though that person's voting power wasn't affected in the first place.

That's a logic flaw: it incorrectly reduces the delegate's vote weight even though their weight was never boosted by that delegation.

### üß™ Let's Break This With a Simple Example

#### Setup

* **Alice** has 100 LPT. She is *not* a transcoder.
* **Bob** has 200 LPT and **delegates** to Alice.
* **Alice votes "Yes"** manually.
* **Bob does not vote manually** ‚Äî his vote follows Alice's (as per delegation logic).

#### Expected Behavior

* Alice's vote should count for **100 LPT**.
* Bob's vote should count for **200 LPT** (via Alice).
* Total "Yes" vote: **300 LPT**

Now, Bob changes his mind.

#### Bob Overrides His Vote

* Bob decides to vote **"No"** manually.
* The protocol says: "Ah, override detected! We must remove Bob's vote from Alice's total, and count it separately."

**Here's the problem:**

* Alice **never had Bob's vote weight** in the first place ‚Äî she's not a transcoder.
* But the system **still deducts 200 LPT** from Alice's vote weight.

#### What Actually Happens

* Alice's vote is now incorrectly reduced to **100 - 200 = -100 LPT**
* Bob's vote is counted as 200 LPT for "No"
* Final vote tally:

  * Yes: **-100 LPT**
  * No: **200 LPT**

‚ùå This is completely wrong.

### üîç Why This Happens

This code snippet is where the issue starts:

```solidity
if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {
    amount = 0;
} else if (isTranscoder) {
    amount = bond.delegatedAmount;
} else {
    amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);
}
```

If the delegate is **not a transcoder**, `delegatedAmount` is *not added* to their vote weight.

But later on, in `_handleVoteOverrides`, the code *still deducts* `_weight` from the `delegateVoter` regardless of whether they ever received that `_weight` in the first place.

This creates an imbalance.

### üéÇ Real-Life Analogy: The Birthday Cake Problem

* You throw a party and order a cake for everyone.
* Each guest gives money to **Alice** to handle the order.
* Alice isn't the one baking or serving the cake (that's what transcoders do).
* Still, some guests (like Bob) change their mind and decide to get their own slice.
* The system says: "Okay, take Bob's slice back from Alice!"

But wait ‚Äî Alice **never had** Bob's slice to begin with.

Still, the system reduces her share of the cake, even though she was only eating her own. Now, she gets less cake for no reason.

## Vulnerable Code Reference

```solidity
// Inside _handleVoteOverrides()
ProposalVoterState storage delegateVoter = _tally.voters[delegate];
delegateVoter.deductions += _weight;

if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {
    VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;
    _subtractSupport(tally, delegateSupport, _weight);
}
```

### Problem

* `_tally.voters[delegate]` is mutated to include a deduction **before checking** if the delegate has even voted.
* Deductions are applied regardless of whether:

  * The delegate has cast a vote.
  * The delegate is a valid transcoder anymore.

## Recommended Mitigation

1. **Add validation checks** before applying deductions:

   * Ensure the delegate is still a registered transcoder.
   * Ensure the delegate has actually cast a vote for this proposal.

2. **Apply deductions conditionally**:

   * Only subtract vote weight from delegate's support outcome if `delegateVoter.hasVoted` is `true`.
   * Otherwise, skip deduction logic entirely.

3. **Emit events** when deductions are applied to improve traceability during audits or debugging.

## Pattern Recognition Notes

This vulnerability stems from improper assumptions during vote overrides in delegation-based systems ‚Äî especially when vote deductions are applied without validating the delegate's eligibility.

Here are core patterns to watch for:

1. **Delegate Eligibility Checks Are Missing**
    * Ensure that vote deductions only apply if the delegate (e.g., transcoder) was eligible to receive vote weight during the snapshot. Don't assume every delegate is a valid vote-carrier.

2. **Invalid Deduction on Ineligible Delegates**
    * If a delegate didn't contribute to the original vote tally (e.g., not a transcoder), applying a deduction on override leads to undercounting ‚Äî or even negative tallies.

3. **Role Transitions Before Snapshot**
    * A user might become ineligible (e.g., step down as a transcoder) after receiving delegated weight. Systems should check role status at snapshot time, not current state.

4. **Mismatch in Snapshot Timing**
    * Vote weight and delegate role should both be determined using the same snapshot round. Mismatches can introduce logical inconsistencies.

5. **Missing Edge-Case Tests**

    Always test scenarios where:
    * Delegator overrides vote from an invalid or inactive delegate.
    * Delegate voted, then lost eligibility.
    * Multiple delegators delegate to an inactive address.

6. **Separate Delegation vs. Voting Logic**
    * Avoid combining vote casting and delegation logic into one flow. Treat them distinctly to prevent unintentional interactions.
